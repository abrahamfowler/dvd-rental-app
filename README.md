I encountered a few problems with my database. One of them was the interjoin between the customer and the customers order. When I click a customers name it takes me to the page but it doesnâ€™t show the orders that they have purchased. Another problem that I encoutered was with my log in page where I used a session register and I found out that a way to solve it using sessions and I found from this link: http://php.net/manual/en/

The function.session-register.php (the use of sessions_register) is deprecated. The login page works now.
